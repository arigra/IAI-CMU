# Radar_Data

This repository is for mergeing the RADDet, CARRADA and CRUW datasets, into a large, single dataset that we can work with on our outer projects.

## links for the datasets:

RADDet: https://github.com/ZhangAoCanada/RADDet?tab=readme-ov-file
CARRADA: http://download.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/Carrada/
CRUW: https://www.cruwdataset.org/download

the datasets and the merged dataset will be uploaded to an s3 bucket as soon as we can set it up

another idea to consider is transforming the IPIX dataset (a naval radar for aerial targets, instead of car radar) into RD maps so we can use that too.
